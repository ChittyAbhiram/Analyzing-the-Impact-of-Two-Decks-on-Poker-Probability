# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Two-Decks-on-Poker-Probability

Since its early 19th-century origins, poker as a favorite pastime for many card game lovers has evolved into many versions, adding twists to captivate players. This project takes that spirit of innovation to a classic 5-card poker setup, adding a twist: two decks in play. With this double-deck approach, we uncover how variations in deck composition influence hand probabilities and strategic gameplay. To dive deeper into these probabilities, we turn to the Law of Large Numbers (LLN), a cornerstone concept in probability and statistics. In poker, the LLN helps us understand what outcomes to expect as we simulate thousands—or even millions—of hands. Essentially, the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states that as the number of trials or observations increases, the observed frequencies of events tend to stabilize around theoretical probabilities.
